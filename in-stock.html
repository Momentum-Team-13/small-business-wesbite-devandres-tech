          Wild hyacinth: This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. The bulb
          grows best in well-drained soil high in humus. It will grow in lightly
          shaded forest areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadows
          or prairies. Additionally it is found growing alongside streams and
          rivers. The plants may be divided in autumn after the leaves have
          withered. Bulbs should be planted in the autumn. Additionally the
          plant spreads by seed rather than by runners.

          Lily-of-the-Valley: With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge
          bells that dangle above bright emerald-green leaves -- this nearly
          deer-proof shade lover appears to be delicate in an old-fashioned way.
          But the pretty plant is also an intrepid wanderer, spreading readily
          and rapidly, and anyone who gardens in a small space will want to
          watch this perennial to make sure it stays in bounds. Tolerates shade
          well. Warning: this plant is poisonous.
